Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns placing their mark (an "X" or an "O") on an empty square. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
